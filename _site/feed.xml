Traditionally this region has been known for its vast tea plantations, which is one of Sri Lanka‚Äôs biggest industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days this laidback town attracts backpackers and adventure seekers alike. Stunning natural scenery, a growing food and nightlife scene and the famous Nine Arches Bridge have helped Ella to become a nailed on destination for tourists visiting Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aFuIOWW.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Ella with the intention of staying three nights before moving onto Kandy. On the third day we extended it to five. There were two reasons that influenced our decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúSri Lanka Declares State of Emergency After Mob Attacks on Muslims‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;span class=&quot;default-color&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The New York Times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúSri Lanka violence: State of emergency declared over attacks‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;span class=&quot;default-color&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BBC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúGrenade kills one as social media blocked‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;span class=&quot;default-color&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Western Advocate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúCurfew Declared in Kandy District: 200 Sinha  Regiment Soldiers and 1000 Special Task Force Personnel Deployed as  Police Fail to Control Anti-Muslim Violence.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;span class=&quot;default-color&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DBSJeyaraj.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah‚Ä¶ that was the main reason we kept the anchor down. The violence had not reached Kandy city, but was happening in several smaller towns and villages in the district. Tensions continued to rise and there was every chance that the violence would spill into the city at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully that day never came, and the violence eventually fizzed out. With only 10 days in Sri Lanka this had the potential to spoil what had so farbeen a great trip. We faced a dilemma which meant altering our plans, or risk our safety by heading straight into the eye of the storm. Our love for Ella assured us that our decision to stay an extra two nights and bypass Kandy completely was the correct one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-around&quot;&gt;Getting around&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town itself is very small, so it‚Äôs quite easy to get from your hotel room to one of the town‚Äôs many saliva inducing restaurants. The town is nice, but has nothing to attract you other than its bars, shops and restaurants. The things that bring people here are scattered around the surrounding countryside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/V0aQ43G.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A typical Sri Lankan curry. üì∏ by Sarah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre able, get out walking. Many of the main attractions are definitely reachable on foot. If you want to go a bit further there are tuk tuks waiting for you on almost every corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/32b8l97.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ella has a much cooler climate than a lot of Sri Lanka&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people in our hostel rented a motorbike so they could explore by themselves. They said they encountered the most jaw-dropping views as they just set off in a random direction to see what they would find. Total freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vy31zjL.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The roads around Ella were being upgraded when we were there&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-we-stayed&quot;&gt;Where we stayed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came to Ella to see nature, so we decided to stay outside of the town. The 1964 Boutique Hostel ticks that box and more, it‚Äôs about a 25 minute bus ride from Ella town with local buses running regularly at a cost of something like ‚Ç¨0.20 (I can‚Äôt remember the exact price). We walked to the town once and it took about an hour and a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn‚Äôt consider it ‚Äúboutique‚Äù, there‚Äôs barely any WiFi, and the bed was about 6 inches too short, but everything else about this place was great! We tried to extend our stay but with only four bedrooms it filled up easily. The hosts were so nice - they gave us free local tea and cooked amazing homemade Sri Lankan meals. They also had a tuk tuk service to bring us to places the bus didn‚Äôt go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At ‚Ç¨10/night for a private room, how could you go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-to-do&quot;&gt;Things to do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many things to do here. Just walking through the tea plantations could take up hours of your life. Time well spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;walking-through-the-tea-plantations&quot;&gt;Walking through the tea plantations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They‚Äôre just glorified hedges that you can drink, yet they look so damn &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. Right behind our hostel (which was outside of the town) we were right beside fields and fields of tea. Going for a morning walk and being greeted with joy from all the workers out picking was one of our favourite things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;demodara-nine-arches-bridge&quot;&gt;Demodara Nine Arches Bridge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nine Arches Bridge is a spectacular feat of engineering. 24 metres tall and 91 metres in length, it was constructed during the British colonial-era as part of a railway system that spans the length and breadth of the country. In its day the railway would have been used to mainly transport coffee and tea from the hills to the country‚Äôs main shipping ports. These days it welcomes the public too, offering some of the finest views on an extremely slow and packed train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get here you will probably need a map of some kind, as the bridge can‚Äôt be seen from the roadside. We used Maps.me for Android, which uses OpenStreetMap data. Unlike Google Maps, OpenStreetMap data is crowdsourced, meaning any person like you or me can contribute to it. The route we chose brought us off the road and through the tea-plantations on a tiny dirt path to the bridge, which had us amazed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/p2RtiGU.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Searching for the Nine Arches Bridge. üì∏ by Sarah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a little while walking through the tea maze we came to an opening where a local man started trying to usher us in the opposite direction to the map route, saying ‚ÄúBridge!‚Äù every now and then in an effort to reassure us. We were hesitant, but decided to trust him as there were some other tourists with him, en route to the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He started bringing us a very long and unusual way, through houses until we weren‚Äôt really on a path anymore. We cut our losses and turned around in the direction we came from to go back on our original path, ignoring the man‚Äôs yells back at us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met that same couple down at the bridge later, so at least he was actually bringing people there. My feeling is that he brings people this way so that he can ask for money when they come back! My advice would be to just ignore these people, use Maps.me and you‚Äôll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we got to the bridge, we came across a great viewing point with a simple little tea shop, where you can sit and sip on some local tea and wait for one of the five (I think) daily trains to pass. When we got here, a scribbled timetable told us that the next train was two hours away, so we didn‚Äôt wait for it. Be sure to check with your hostel before going if you want to catch one!&lt;/p&gt;

According to legend, KIng Rawana used this cave to hide the princess Sita. Even if that much is folklore, excavations undertaken in the cave revealed evidence of human habitation dating back 25,000 years!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prepare to climb some 650 steps to reach the cave. We enjoyed it, but it‚Äôs quite small when you get there so I‚Äôm sure many people are left disappointed at spending their money and sweat to see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 3/4 of the way up to the cave there is a hut selling coconut drinks. We stopped off on our way back down for a rest and to try a King coconut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little Adam‚Äôs Peak is a pretty easy hike. It attracts tourists and locals, who come to take in the spectacular 360¬∞ views from atop the 1141 metre high summit, which looks down on the valley below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get on the trail leading to the top you must go to the 98 Acres Resort and follow the signs from there. It‚Äôs well signposted, you shouldn‚Äôt get lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-on&quot;&gt;Moving on&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodbye Ella, goodbye Sri Lanka! 10 days wasn‚Äôt near enough in this country. There were so many places we wanted to fit into our itnerary but just couldn‚Äôt, like Udawalewe National Park, Sigiriya and Lipton‚Äôs Seat. I guess that just leaves us with good reason to come back üòâ!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson we learned from India and Sri Lanka is that slow travel beats fast travel. With that we decided to spend just over two months in Thailand (exceeding our visa and getting a fine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short flight we were on the ground again and walking through Colombo Airport in search of a booth to buy some local SIM cards and reconnect to the grid. Prior research told us that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dialog.lk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dialog&lt;/a&gt; is the best network for 4G coverage, which is all we really cared about when it came to choosing a network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that the next thing to do was find an ATM and withdraw some rupees. You know the way ATMs normally give you back your card before producing the cash? The one I used must have missed that day in ATM University, so I ended up leaving my travel card in the ATM and didn‚Äôt realise until several hours later when there was over 120 kilometres of highway between us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good job I had opened an account with &lt;a href=&quot;https://n26.com/en-eu/bank-account&quot;&gt;N26&lt;/a&gt; before leaving. I literally just had to open their app on my phone and block all withdrawals and transactions with the tap of a button. If you‚Äôre in the EU you should definitely consider getting an N26 Black card if you are going to be abroad for a long time. It‚Äôs &lt;del&gt;‚Ç¨5.90/month&lt;/del&gt; &lt;strong&gt;‚Ç¨9.90/month&lt;/strong&gt; but you will make up that cost with fee-free payments and withdrawals and an Allianz insurance package! This is not an ad, it‚Äôs just really really good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unawatuna&quot;&gt;Unawatuna&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With only 10 days to see the country we decided not to stay in Colombo, instead heading straight from the airport to Unawatuna on the southwest coast. This may be a small town but it is one of Sri Lanka‚Äôs biggest tourist destinations, best known for its long and curving golden beach, shielded by palm trees, restaurants and resorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-here&quot;&gt;Getting here&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were three feasible ways for us to get from the airport to our hostel in Unawatuna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bus&quot;&gt;Bus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to take the bus here‚Äôs what you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bus No. 187&lt;/strong&gt; from the airport bus station to Colombo Fort. Buses run &lt;strong&gt;every 30 minutes&lt;/strong&gt; between 05:30 and 18:30. The journey should take around &lt;strong&gt;45 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;, at a cost of &lt;strong&gt;Rs. 110 (‚Ç¨0.58)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From here, take &lt;strong&gt;Bus No. 2&lt;/strong&gt; to Matara (getting off at Galle). Buses run &lt;strong&gt;every 30 minutes&lt;/strong&gt; between 05:00 and 20:00. It should take around &lt;strong&gt;3 hours&lt;/strong&gt;. It costs &lt;strong&gt;Rs. 490 (‚Ç¨2.58)&lt;/strong&gt; to Matara so it should be a little bit less to Galle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a tuk tuk from Galle to Unawatuna. This should take around &lt;strong&gt;15 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;train&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Train&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bus No. 187&lt;/strong&gt; from the airport bus station to Colombo Fort. Buses run &lt;strong&gt;every 30 minutes&lt;/strong&gt; between 05:30 and 18:30. The journey should take around &lt;strong&gt;45 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;, at a cost of &lt;strong&gt;Rs. 110 (‚Ç¨0.58)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the train from Colombo Fort to Galle. There are &lt;strong&gt;10 trains per day&lt;/strong&gt;, from 06:55 to 19:30. The journey should take a little over &lt;strong&gt;3 hours&lt;/strong&gt; (but often more). A 3rd class ticket cost &lt;strong&gt;Rs. 100 (‚Ç¨0.53)&lt;/strong&gt;, and 2nd class tickets are &lt;strong&gt;Rs. 180 (‚Ç¨0.95)&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://slr.malindaprasad.com/index.php?from=FOT&amp;amp;to=GLE&quot;&gt;Full Schedule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a tuk tuk from Galle to Unawatuna. This should take around &lt;strong&gt;15 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;car-rental-with-driver&quot;&gt;Car rental with driver&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having just landed in the country we didn‚Äôt have a clue about what train or bus to take. We went to the tourist information desk in the airport and they recommended getting a private car with a driver. We decided to go with this as it was the easiest option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were quoted &lt;strong&gt;Rs. 60,000 (‚Ç¨80)&lt;/strong&gt; for the journey. We were hesitant about parting with so much of our money until we met someone from our plane who was travelling a little bit further south along the same route to Mirissa so we split the fare three ways. We ended up paying &lt;strong&gt;Rs. 5,000 (‚Ç¨26) each&lt;/strong&gt;‚Ä¶which wasn‚Äôt as bad, but it is still extremely expensive for Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey was great though, and somewhat worth the price for the comfort and convenience. It only took us about &lt;strong&gt;2 hours&lt;/strong&gt; and the driver brought us right to the door of our hostel!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-around&quot;&gt;Getting around&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;walking&quot;&gt;Walking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you get to Unawatuna you can easily walk everywhere. I would recommend staying near the beach though as you‚Äôll never need to walk any longer than 10 minutes! Our hostel was about a 30 minute walk from the beach. Most of this walk is along the A2 Highway that connects Colombo to the south of the country. This is a really busy highway with huge lorries and buses thundering past at every hour - I wouldn‚Äôt advise walking on it at night as it‚Äôs a bit dangerous‚Ä¶though we did once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tuk-tuk&quot;&gt;Tuk tuk&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah the good ol‚Äô trusty tuk tuk. Well, I wouldn‚Äôt go that far. Expect to pay &lt;strong&gt;Rs. 50-60 (‚Ç¨0.60) per kilometre&lt;/strong&gt; in Unawatuna and most places in the country. Rarely will you find a metered taxi - it‚Äôs ‚Äúbroken‚Äù. Of course, they will try and charge you much more than this, but bargain, bargain hard. Walk away and they will drop their price, guaranteed. They‚Äôre sound though, just trying their luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3rcvqYS.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;There‚Äôs no better way to see the world than from the back of a tuk tuk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;places-to-eat&quot;&gt;Places to eat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one place in Unawatuna you &lt;em&gt;must try&lt;/em&gt;! I couldn‚Äôt find it online, it‚Äôs not on Google Maps and I don‚Äôt think it has a name. You can find it on &lt;strong&gt;Welle Dewayala road&lt;/strong&gt; (the road connecting the highway to Unawatuna beach) on your right as you walk towards the beach. They have one dish and they make it well. &lt;strong&gt;Kottu Roti&lt;/strong&gt;. It‚Äôs a tiny place with only two or three tables, so you will be lucky to get a seat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oj7N4mY.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;If you see this on the wall outside you‚Äôve come to the right place!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;galle-fort&quot;&gt;Galle Fort&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made a day-trip from Unawatuna to Galle, to see the famous Galle Fort. Built by the Portuguese in 1588, it remained under their control until 1640, when the Dutch captured it. They then proceeded to extensively fortify it and make it their headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/galle-dutch-fort-sri-lanka-map.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-2&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-around-1&quot;&gt;Getting around&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get to the main gate there will be several tuk tuk drivers waiting to tell you ‚Äúit‚Äôs too big to walk, I will bring you around‚Äù. Don‚Äôt listen to them, it‚Äôs easy to walk around here and it‚Äôs the most fun thing about this place. To me there are no stand out attractions in Galle Fort. The collective experience of taking the long way around and coming across the attractions in your own time is what makes visiting this place so enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sOCKfVN.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The clock tower is one of the first things you will see when you arrive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days in Unawatuna and Galle really isn‚Äôt enough, but we only had 10 days so we couldn‚Äôt stay any longer.

Unawatuna

With only 10 days to see the country we decided not to stay in Colombo, instead heading straight from the airport to Unawatuna on the southwest coast.

God‚Äôs Own Country. Actually that title belongs to the Wicklow Mountains in Ireland but we‚Äôll forgive them for that one. Just this once. After all, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_places_called_Venice_of_North&quot;&gt;40 Venice of the Norths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_of_the_East&quot;&gt;24 Paris of the Easts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Wonder_of_the_World&quot;&gt;50 Eighth Wonders of the World&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God%27s_Own_Country&quot;&gt;another six places&lt;/a&gt; in the world that God himself calls his own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waterfalls, beaches, rainforests, national parks, mountains, picture-perfect tea plantations and a network of freshwater rivers, canals, lakes and lagoons collectively known as the ‚ÄúKerala Backwaters‚Äù (and Venice of the East). I can see why God likes Kerala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly we didn‚Äôt see the majority of what I just listed. For the final leg of the trip we decided to slow it right down in a country that doesn‚Äôt know the meaning of the word ‚Äúslow‚Äù - and focus our adventures on two places: Kochi and Kovalam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came to this decision while scanning over the itinerary we had created, which revealed a packed schedule - in transit every two or three days and spending over 50 hours sitting, standing or laying in a train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kochi&quot;&gt;Kochi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kochi is an ancient port city in south-central Kerala, founded way back in the 14th century. It has a long history of trading with many countries from all over the Old World, including Portugal, Netherlands, China and Japan, which has over time created a distinct cosmopolitan culture unlike any other place in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being well known around the world from of its valuable spice trade industry was probably a big reason why the Portuguese chose it as their gateway to colonisation in India, with occupation beginning in 1503. To this day you can still see the effects of colonisation in the old town, with European influences on architecture, art and religion visible everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-around&quot;&gt;Getting around&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you‚Äôll probably want to stay in or near Fort Kochi (also referred to as the old town or Old Kochi). This is where most of the tourist attractions and some of the best restaurants are found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you heed my advice you‚Äôll find that most places can easily be reached on foot. If you‚Äôre not into walking, cycling is a great way to get around the old town as the roads are pretty calm and most journeys should take no longer than 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YriqAQH.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A gorgeous little street in Old Kochi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a local bus network in Kochi that is apparently very good, but the tuk tuks are so cheap and convenient we just used them whenever we needed to go on a longer journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;things-to-do&quot;&gt;Things to do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could probably visit most of the top attractions Fort Kochi has in a day. It‚Äôs worth staying a bit longer as the town itself has a nice vibe and there‚Äôs a great restaurant scene. Here are the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;elephant-festival&quot;&gt;Elephant Festival&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entry: free&lt;/em&gt;. The day we arrived to Kochi our host told us about an elephant festival that would be happening nearby at 17:00. I don‚Äôt think this is an everyday occurrence, we just got lucky with the day we arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were excited with what we saw as this was our first time seeing elephants this close up and outside of a zoo. There was a short parade followed by traditional music and a ritual which ended with a blessing of the elephants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hsUhWIF.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly the legs of these gentle giants were chained together and all three of them had a couple of men sitting or standing on their backs. At this time we weren‚Äôt aware of how serious and horrible elephant cruelty is in India and many other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back with this new information the whole event seemed a bit cruel and unfair. Who knows, maybe these ones were well cared for but evidence would suggest otherwise. Watch the video below and decide on the ethicality of such an event for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

Established to showcase the Portuguese influence on Kochi and the surrounding areas, this is a small museum displaying mostly Christian relics and artefacts. We didn‚Äôt find it particularly interesting and didn‚Äôt stay long. It could be something to do if you have a lot of time to spare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;st-francis-church&quot;&gt;St. Francis Church&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entry: free&lt;/em&gt;. To look at, it‚Äôs just an ordinary no frills old church, badly in need of some maintenance, but looks don‚Äôt write history. Built in 1503, this is the oldest European church in India. Over the years it has changed hands several times between the Portuguese, Dutch and British as they battled for control over the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sitar-and-tabla-performance&quot;&gt;Sitar and Tabla Performance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entry: Rs. 200&lt;/em&gt;. A flyer advertising a sitar and tabla performance in Kerala Kathakali Centre caught our eye as we wandered the quaint streets of Old Kochi so we decided to check it out. We had absolutely no idea what a sitar and tabla were or what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We loved it. The performance began at 20:00 and consisted of two talented musicians - one on sitar and the other on tabla - playing an intimate one hour set of hypnotising instrumental music. I think the small audience was in a trance as the only noises in the entire hour came from those beautiful instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll admit, we‚Äôre not fan the biggest fans of an Indian breakfast. We always ended up getting some of our favourite Western breakfasts which can be easily found in tourist areas. It‚Äôs been five months and I still have dreams about the breakfast we had in Qissa.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kovalam&quot;&gt;Kovalam&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn‚Äôt plan to do too much in Kovalam. Besides, there‚Äôs not really anything to do apart from chill at the beach which is exactly what we wanted. I was still trying to go from pale to slightly less pale and five days in sunny Kovalam is a good place to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs also a quick 20 minute drive to Trivandrum Airport, where we were due to fly to Sri Lanka from on March 6th. This tipped the balance in favour of Kovalam when we were deciding where to stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-around-1&quot;&gt;Getting around&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kovalam is a small town of about 8,000. As the only things of interest to tourists are the beach and lighthouse you should be able to reach most places within a five minute walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to find some cheaper local restaurants or an ATM (there aren‚Äôt any on the tourist strip oddly enough) you will need to venture a couple of streets back up a steep hill, which could take you 15 minutes or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;things-to-do-1&quot;&gt;Things to do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than lounging on the beach, browsing the small gift shops and dining, there‚Äôs not a whole lot to do here, which is exactly what attracts people. It‚Äôs a popular holiday destination where foreign and domestic tourists as well as locals come and enjoy the beach, seafood and sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;kovalam-beach&quot;&gt;Kovalam Beach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entry: free&lt;/em&gt;. Poular with locals, this is a really nice beach but it is always &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; busy, so if you‚Äôre looking for something a bit more peaceful you should head back to Goa. We had a great time here sunbathing on the beach and cooling off in the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be our final destination in India, but there‚Äôs still a few more posts to come. Next week (or the week after) I‚Äôll show you a one minute highlights video that I made.

Waterfalls, beaches, rainforests, national parks, mountains, picture-perfect tea plantations and a network of freshwater rivers, canals, lakes and lagoons collectively known as the ‚ÄúKerala Backwaters‚Äù (and Venice of the East). I can see why God likes Kerala.

Sadly we didn‚Äôt see the majority of what I just listed. For the final leg of the trip we decided to slow it right down in a country that doesn‚Äôt know the meaning of the word ‚Äúslow‚Äù - and focus our adventures on two places: Kochi and Kovalam.

We came to this decision while scanning over the itinerary we had created, which revealed a packed schedule - in transit every two or three days and spending over 50 hours sitting, standing or laying in a train.

Kochi

Kochi is an ancient port city in south-central Kerala, founded way back in the 14th century. It has a long history of trading with many countries from all over the Old World, including Portugal, Netherlands, China and Japan, which has over time created a distinct cosmopolitan culture unlike any other place in India.

Being well known around the world from of its valuable spice trade industry was probably a big reason why the Portuguese chose it as their gateway to colonisation in India, with occupation beginning in 1503. To this day you can still see the effects of colonisation in the old town, with European influences on architecture, art and religion visible everywhere.

Getting around

So you‚Äôll probably want to stay in or near Fort Kochi (also referred to as the old town or Old Kochi). This is where most of the tourist attractions and some of the best restaurants are found.

If you heed my advice you‚Äôll find that most places can easily be reached on foot. If you‚Äôre not into walking, cycling is a great way to get around the old town as the roads are pretty calm and most journeys should take no longer than 15 minutes.

Things to do

You could probably visit most of the top attractions Fort Kochi has in a day. It‚Äôs worth staying a bit longer as the town itself has a nice vibe and there‚Äôs a great restaurant scene. Here are the highlights.

Truth be told there‚Äôs not much happening in the village itself, but that‚Äôs not what you come to see. Things used to be very different in Hampi; this was once a wealthy and thriving city, which became the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 14th century until 1565 when the empire was defeated and the city destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Hampi is dotted with hundreds of Hindu temples, structures and monuments, all in varying states of ruin, over an area covering 26km¬≤. It is surrounded by a stunning and unusual natural landscape of sandstone boulder hills that stretch farther than the eye can see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-here&quot;&gt;Getting here&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like everywhere else in this trip, we came here by train. Well, nearly. Hampi itself doesn‚Äôt have a train station, the nearest being a 30 minute drive away in Hosapete. Because the choice of accommodation in Hampi is pretty poor we decided to base ourselves from Hosapete and make a day trip to Hampi by tuk tuk. This also allowed us to be close to the train station for our 06:20 departure time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting here was easy; a short eight hour train ride from Goa (yes eight hours is short in India) had us there by midafternoon and 20 minutes later we were checked into our hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stuck this leg of our trip in between two visits to Goa as direct onward trave to Kochi (our next destination) from Hosapete was proving to be awkward and long. The &lt;strong&gt;shortest&lt;/strong&gt; train journey on this route is almost 26 hours, and that‚Äôs before you factor in the guaranteed delays that would probably drag that figure up to 29 or more. I love train travel, but no way am I staying on one for that long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-around&quot;&gt;Getting around&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of Hampi‚Äôs structures are together in clusters, so for the most part you can easily get around on foot. However, as Hampi is quite spread out, naturally so are some of its clusters, so you will probably need another mode of transport to cover the longer distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs pretty easy to find a tuk tuk - there are plenty waiting close to the main attractions or parked in the shade of big trees to avoid the unforgiving heat from the sun, so we made use of their services once or twice. Bicycles are another way to get around and you can rent them in the village, but we decided it might be difficult to cycle in such high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hampi&quot;&gt;Hampi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entry: free&lt;/em&gt;. We only had one full day to see Hampi so we decided to have an early(ish) start to make the most of it. We left our hotel at around 08:30 after filling up on a big breakfast and immediately spotted a tuk tuk waiting to greet his first customer of the day, and got to Hampi a little after 09:00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Joining the morning rush to Hampi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn‚Äôt want a tour guide herding us around like sheep to the same few places they show everyone and missing out on the chance to explore the place on our own, but we also wanted to understand what it is we are looking at and how to find our way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a small Hampi guidebook book for sale in our hotel and bought it for around Rs. 150 (less than ‚Ç¨2). This really came in handy as we could just pop it open at any time and read about everything on the spot. This let us to go at our own pace and for a fraction of the price of a tour guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs totally free to get in to Hampi and to see most of the ruins, which is pretty great. However, if you want to see some of the main attractions there is a fee of Rs. 500 (‚Ç¨6.28) for foreigners. Virupaksha Temple is only an additional Rs. 2 to go inside but we didn‚Äôt even bother as we were a little bit strapped for time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is an unbelievably fair price when you see that a one day pass for the not too dissimilar Angkor Archeological Park in Cambodia is ‚Ç¨32. Angkor is amazing and all but there is no way that it‚Äôs five times better, and in some ways I actually preferred Hampi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever decide to come put &lt;em&gt;Climb Matanga Hill&lt;/em&gt; on your &lt;em&gt;Things I must do in Hampi&lt;/em&gt; list. It is the highest point in all of Hampi so you truly get a unique viewpoint of this ancient city, and on a clear day you can see for miles around. It‚Äôs not very difficult to climb, but the heat and humidity of the day poses the greatest challenge to you making it to the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Beginning the ascent of Matanga Hill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs one reason it is probably best to go earlier or later in the day, for sunrise or sunset. The other reason being the stunning views you will be rewarded with at these times. We started the ascent at around 11:00, just as the temperature was moving from very hot (32¬∞C) to very very hot (34¬∞C).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/X6jbkYb.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;How about that for a view?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3ntekB1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Okay, one last time. These are small‚Ä¶ but the ones out there are far away&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views from the summit of this giant hill of boulders were simply breathtaking. In the distance we could make out Virupaksha Temple, standing at 49 metres high but made to look 49 millimetres tall from up here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was just the time of day, but there was nobody else here except for us and Gareth from New Zealand who we met halfway up. No waiting for someone to take their selfies so we could walk past them before waiting for the next person to take their selfies so we could walk past them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/A7sDPRd.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúHey I think I can see my house from here!‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-on&quot;&gt;Moving on&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, we felt that we didn‚Äôt give ourselves enough time here. I feel that there is unfinished business between me and Hampi, and I definitely want to return and take my sweet time to explore it all and soak everything in. Nonetheless, what a spectacular place. Go here. Do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to Goa after this, but I‚Äôve &lt;a href=&quot;/travel/india/a-month-in-india-goa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;already talked about that&lt;/a&gt;. So next we will be going to our final state (üòû): Kerala. There‚Äôs plenty to see and do here, but we decided to slow it right down and limit our last week in India to two places - Kochi and Kovalam.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="india" /><category term="travel" /><category term="backpacking" /><category term="hampi" /><category term="temple" /><summary type="html">Hampi is a small rural village in the south Indian state of Karnataka. Truth be told there‚Äôs not much happening in the village itself, but that‚Äôs not what you come to see. Things used to be very different in Hampi; this was once a wealthy and thriving city, which became the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 14th century until 1565 when the empire was defeated and the city destroyed.

Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Hampi is dotted with hundreds of Hindu temples, structures and monuments, all in varying states of ruin, over an area covering 26km¬≤. It is surrounded by a stunning and unusual natural landscape of sandstone boulder hills that stretch farther than the eye can see.

Getting here

Like everywhere else in this trip, we came here by train. Well, nearly. Hampi itself doesn‚Äôt have a train station, the nearest being a 30 minute drive away in Hosapete. Because the choice of accommodation in Hampi is pretty poor we decided to base ourselves from Hosapete and make a day trip to Hampi by tuk tuk. This also allowed us to be close to the train station for our 06:20 departure time.

Getting here was easy; a short eight hour train ride from Goa (yes eight hours is short in India) had us there by midafternoon and 20 minutes later we were checked into our hotel.

We stuck this leg of our trip in between two visits to Goa as direct onward trave to Kochi (our next destination) from Hosapete was proving to be awkward and long. The shortest train journey on this route is almost 26 hours, and that‚Äôs before you factor in the guaranteed delays that would probably drag that figure up to 29 or more. I love train travel, but no way am I staying on one for that long.

Getting around

A lot of Hampi‚Äôs structures are together in clusters, so for the most part you can easily get around on foot. However, as Hampi is quite spread out, naturally so are some of its clusters, so you will probably need another mode of transport to cover the longer distances.

It‚Äôs pretty easy to find a tuk tuk - there are plenty waiting close to the main attractions or parked in the shade of big trees to avoid the unforgiving heat from the sun, so we made use of their services once or twice. Bicycles are another way to get around and you can rent them in the village, but we decided it might be difficult to cycle in such high temperatures.

Hampi

Entry: free. We only had one full day to see Hampi so we decided to have an early(ish) start to make the most of it. We left our hotel at around 08:30 after filling up on a big breakfast and immediately spotted a tuk tuk waiting to greet his first customer of the day, and got to Hampi a little after 09:00.


Joining the morning rush to Hampi

It also marked a halfway point in other ways: crossing the line from northern to southern India also brought a change in climate, food and cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goa‚Äôs biggest attraction is its beaches and the atmosphere that comes with it. The entire state‚Äôs population is less than two million, which is partly made up by its many villages and towns hugging the coastline. You will be spoilt with all the choices really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a party scene with crowds of foreign tourists, water sports and never ending beach parties, then North Goa is for you. In South Goa you can find a much more laid-back atmosphere with small villages, deserted beaches and delicious food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to split our trip to Goa into two parts, so that we could leave in between to visit Hampi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arrosim&quot;&gt;Arrosim&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first part of this trip we stayed a twenty minute drive away from Vasco de Gama (Goa‚Äôs main town) in Arrosim. This sleepy village did not have much going on except for a few small shops and seemed completely unaffected by tourism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fifteen minute walk from here, down a small road and past a couple of quiet resorts will see you arrive at Arrosim Beach. Our first thoughts when we saw it were how vast and empty it was. Perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vUACEFw.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A tiny snake we found at the entrance to Arrosim beach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the entrance to the beach there is a restaurant called &lt;em&gt;Star fish beach shack&lt;/em&gt;. We ate here on both days as there weren‚Äôt many options in the area, but also because of the great seafood, sound owners and free sunbeds for customers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HKfubbR.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sunsets at Arrosim beach are the best that I have seen anywhere. It‚Äôs easy to get a front row seat and watch as the sun gradually changes to a burning shade of red, before disappearing into the Arabian Sea directly in front of you, bringing daytime with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The sun preparing to set at Arrosim beach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-we-stayed&quot;&gt;Where we stayed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in an Airbnb just outside of Arrosim village and only a ten minute walk to the beach. It was a great place to stay and the host Celiano was really nice. We chatted for a good while and he gave us some advice that made the rest of our travels in India a little bit easier. Here‚Äôs a link to his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12144036?s=51&quot;&gt;Airbnb page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;agonda&quot;&gt;Agonda&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we came back from Hampi we headed to another village in South Goa called Agonda, 50km south of Arrosim. This is a large village that has embraced tourism and is buzzing with activity from its multiple bars, restaurants, shops and the beach which is lined with resorts ranging in style from basic to luxurious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JRpT5Vd.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Agonda Beach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with all of the people around, the beach never seemed to get very busy. This is probably helped by the fact that it is both wide and &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; long. Agonda was a winner for us, it‚Äôs really nice and clean with plenty of places to eat, drink and sleep only metres away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-we-stayed-1&quot;&gt;Where we stayed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in a resort which sits right on the north part of the beach called &lt;a href=&quot;http://velvetsunset.com&quot;&gt;Velvet Sunset&lt;/a&gt;. This place was great; the staff were really helpful and it has a great restaurant and bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the porch of our simple wooden hut you could see the ocean. We went with the cheapest option available when booking our room, which got us a fan and cold, salty shower!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;What we could have gotten if we splashed out!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-around&quot;&gt;Getting around&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to get to most places in Goa from the railway station is by taxi. There are local buses, but when you‚Äôve just gotten off an eight hour overnight train you just want to get out of transit as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to save money on a taxi is to look out for other travellers who are going to the same area as you so you can share the fare. This is especially easy in Goa as the majority of people are going to the same few places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you get to your village or town you will easily be able to walk everywhere as the places are usually quite small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-on&quot;&gt;Moving on&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our only regret about Goa is that we didn‚Äôt give ourselves more time here. We loved it and easily could have stayed for another week or more just living a simple beach life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So technically we went to Kerala after Goa, but remember we left in the middle for a few days to visit Hampi, an ancient city which was once the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&lt;/p&gt;

This magnificent site covering an area of 26km¬≤ is dotted with ruined temples and structures which will leave you inspired by what people were able to build hundreds of years ago and in awe of the unique natural landscape that surrounds it.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000JRpT5Vd.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">One Month in India: Mumbai</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/travel/india/a-month-in-india-mumbai" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="One Month in India: Mumbai" /><published>2018-07-03T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-07-03T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/travel/india/a-month-in-india-mumbai</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/travel/india/a-month-in-india-mumbai">&lt;p&gt;Mumbai holds the title of being India‚Äôs largest city, with an estimated population of around 24 million. The commercial centre of India, home to Asia‚Äôs largest slum, the world‚Äôs most expensive home and Bollywood; this is a city of extremes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up staying five nights here. This seems like a lot (and it is), but it was just the awkward timings of our arrival and departure that caused this. We flew from Udaipur and arrived at about 20:00 on 15th February and our onward train was at 05:00 on 20th February. In reality we had four full days to explore the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four days was probably still too much time to spend here - we didn‚Äôt really enjoy it too much. Why? I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on it‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was the lack of cheap and quality accommodation which pushed us a thirty minute drive away from the buzz of Colaba district. Maybe it was the fact we had already been to Delhi so the thrill and culture shock of experiencing a city of this size wasn‚Äôt there anymore. Coming from the beauty and charm of Udaipur probably didn‚Äôt hour expectations either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was just our experience though‚Ä¶it could be completely different for you. I think if we forked out that extra cash to stay in the Colaba district our experience would have been much more positive. It was from this point on that we decided that the most important thing to consider when booking accommodation is its location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever money we saved by choosing a cheaper place to stay was probably negated by those long taxi drives (and our mediocre negotiating skills) to and from our hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-around&quot;&gt;Getting around&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuk tuks are banned from Central Mumbai, so you will probably be riding in taxis more often here. There is a metro but it is relatively new and is actively being expanded. Honestly if you stay in the Colaba district you should be able to walk to most places. We usually got a taxi to here and then walked everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taxi&quot;&gt;Taxi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used taxis for all of our long distance journeys in the city. Like everywhere in India, it‚Äôs rare to find a taxi using a meter so know the standard fares and have an idea of how much your journey should cost. We used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.numbeo.com/taxi-fare/in/Mumbai&quot;&gt;this fare calculator from Numbeo&lt;/a&gt; to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uberola&quot;&gt;Uber/Ola&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have Internet access you should definitely use one of these ride-sharing services for the best deal. At this point we still hadn‚Äôt gotten sorted with a working Indian SIM card, so were still working it the old fashioned way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;metro&quot;&gt;Metro&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I‚Äôve said, the Mumbai Metro network is still a work in progress and is not nearly as expansive as the one in Delhi. We used it a couple of times and found it be a very efficient and easy way to get across the city, avoiding all those messy traffic jams. Unlike the Delhi Metro, there is no tourist day pass so you will be paying on a journey by journey basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;walking&quot;&gt;Walking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I‚Äôm not suggesting that you can walk to anywhere in the city (far from it), but if you are in the right areas walking in Mumbai is a breeze. This is in part thanks to an extremely positive change introduced in late 2017 which banned kiosks, parked (and moving) vehicles and other annoying obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-to-do&quot;&gt;Things to do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visiting Asia‚Äôs biggest slum was our favourite activity in Mumbai. On the face of it, most people would consider this a bit unethical. We were like that too, but a bit of research goes a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tour company we chose, &lt;a href=&quot;http://realitytoursandtravel.com/dharavi-tour.php&quot;&gt;Reality Tours &amp;amp; Travel&lt;/a&gt;, was set up with the aim of destigmatizing the world‚Äôs view on this 2.1 km¬≤ area that houses one million of Mumbai‚Äôs inhabitants. Our guide Tavrej lives in Dharavi, and he really was amazing in helping to achieve the vision of educating us about Mumbai‚Äôs beating heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5564/31364575501_92e14a9580_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rooftop View&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of Dharavi‚Äôs citizens do not want to leave this place they call home, despite past government efforts to help relocate them. Any why would they? They have a hospital, schools, markets, mosques, temples and many thriving industries that have a combined annual turnover of approximately $665 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To respect the locals‚Äô privacy we were requested not to take photographs during the tour. Instead, they provided us with a collection of photos from around Dharavi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-on&quot;&gt;Moving on&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Mumbai wasn‚Äôt for us. I think we just wanted to get out of the cities. Luckily for us, our next destination would be as far removed from big city life as you can imagine. Goa is a blend of Indian and Portuguese cultures: with small villages, quiet beaches, fresh seafood and a laid-back atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="india" /><category term="travel" /><category term="backpacking" /><category term="mumbai" /><summary type="html">Mumbai holds the title of being India‚Äôs largest city, with an estimated population of around 24 million. The commercial centre of India, home to Asia‚Äôs largest slum, the world‚Äôs most expensive home and Bollywood; this is a city of extremes.

We ended up staying five nights here. This seems like a lot (and it is), but it was just the awkward timings of our arrival and departure that caused this. We flew from Udaipur and arrived at about 20:00 on 15th February and our onward train was at 05:00 on 20th February. In reality we had four full days to explore the city.

Four days was probably still too much time to spend here - we didn‚Äôt really enjoy it too much. Why? I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on it‚Ä¶

Maybe it was the lack of cheap and quality accommodation which pushed us a thirty minute drive away from the buzz of Colaba district. Maybe it was the fact we had already been to Delhi so the thrill and culture shock of experiencing a city of this size wasn‚Äôt there anymore. Coming from the beauty and charm of Udaipur probably didn‚Äôt hour expectations either.

This was just our experience though‚Ä¶it could be completely different for you. I think if we forked out that extra cash to stay in the Colaba district our experience would have been much more positive. It was from this point on that we decided that the most important thing to consider when booking accommodation is its location.

Whatever money we saved by choosing a cheaper place to stay was probably negated by those long taxi drives (and our mediocre negotiating skills) to and from our hotel.

Getting around

Tuk tuks are banned from Central Mumbai, so you will probably be riding in taxis more often here. There is a metro but it is relatively new and is actively being expanded. Honestly if you stay in the Colaba district you should be able to walk to most places. We usually got a taxi to here and then walked everywhere else.

Taxi

We used taxis for all of our long distance journeys in the city. Like everywhere in India, it‚Äôs rare to find a taxi using a meter so know the standard fares and have an idea of how much your journey should cost. We used this fare calculator from Numbeo to do just that.

Uber/Ola

If you have Internet access you should definitely use one of these ride-sharing services for the best deal. At this point we still hadn‚Äôt gotten sorted with a working Indian SIM card, so were still working it the old fashioned way.

Metro

As I‚Äôve said, the Mumbai Metro network is still a work in progress and is not nearly as expansive as the one in Delhi. We used it a couple of times and found it be a very efficient and easy way to get across the city, avoiding all those messy traffic jams. Unlike the Delhi Metro, there is no tourist day pass so you will be paying on a journey by journey basis.

Walking

Now I‚Äôm not suggesting that you can walk to anywhere in the city (far from it), but if you are in the right areas walking in Mumbai is a breeze. This is in part thanks to an extremely positive change introduced in late 2017 which banned kiosks, parked (and moving) vehicles and other annoying obstacles.

So, Mumbai wasn‚Äôt for us. I think we just wanted to get out of the cities. Luckily for us, our next destination would be as far removed from big city life as you can imagine.

In this post we head west to Udaipur, in the desert state of Rajasthan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Udaipur is a &lt;em&gt;must visit&lt;/em&gt; if you travel to India. It is sometimes called the ‚ÄúWhite City‚Äù because of the colour of the buildings in the old city. It s also known as the ‚ÄúCity of Lakes‚Äù because of its several artificial lakes. I‚Äôve seen it called the ‚ÄúVenice of the East‚Äù because of these lakes, but this title &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_places_called_Venice_of_the_East&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;seems to be used for any city with a bit of water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent a total of four days here, and in that short period we fell in love with the charming aura of this old city. The people, mouth watering food, narrow winding streets, picturesque lakes, the beautiful palaces and temples all created a special atmosphere like nowhere else in India (that we visited).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-around&quot;&gt;Getting around&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are staying in the old city (which you should) you can reach most places by foot pretty easily. As confusing and unplanned as the streets seemed we never managed to get lost. Most streets are pedestrian friendly, helped by the fact that they are narrow; rendering them unsuitable to anything other than people, bikes and cows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most activities and sights of interest are located in and around the old city. If you need to go further afield to the new city or if you‚Äôre just tired of walking around you can easily find a tuk tuk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked nearly everywhere in Udaipur. Most streets and alleys have something interesting that make them worth walking down. Many have some form of street art; styles varied from your typical modern street ‚Äúgraffiti‚Äù to some traditional Rajput-style murals like in the picture below. Other than that you will see animals chilling in the sun or street vendors plying their trade throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

We got a private ensuite bedroom for Rs 700 (‚Ç¨8.84)/night. Bargain! And no, we didn‚Äôt have to compromise on quality for that price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the nicest places we stayed in during this trip! It was clean, comfortable, the owners were really friendly and the rooftop restaurant served good food with a view. However, there were two downsides to staying here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both were woken up a few times every night because of dogs in the area barking constantly. There is also a mosque nearby and they like to convene for their daily prayers at dawn, which meant that we were awake very early every day.&lt;/p&gt;

We came during the day but I can imagine that the view would be particularly special at sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

Where we stayed

We stayed in a guesthouse called Mewargarh Palace for our three nights in Udaipur. We got a private ensuite bedroom for Rs 700 (‚Ç¨8.84)/night. Bargain! And no, we didn‚Äôt have to compromise on quality for that price.

This was one of the nicest places we stayed in during this trip! It was clean, comfortable, the owners were really friendly and the rooftop restaurant served good food with a view. However, there were two downsides to staying here.

Both of these downsides were not the fault of the guesthouse and you should kind of expect noises like this if you‚Äôre staying in a city. So yes, I would definitely recommend staying here‚Ä¶ just be to sure to bring a good pair of earplugs üëç.

&lt;p&gt;Every year up to eight million people travel from all over the world to see it. A UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the New7Wonders of the World, your goldfish has probably heard of the Taj Mahal. It is the most &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; place I have been to in my entire life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-here&quot;&gt;Getting here&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Delhi, Agra takes just over three hours by train, covering some 206 kilometres. This was to be our first of several train rides in India, and it was something we were both nervous and excited for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; difficult to even reach a stage where we could purchase our tickets online, and were about to look into alternative modes of transport when we finally came up with a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously‚Ä¶it took over a month to register on the official train reservation website. I even went to the length of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PhelanEnda/status/951129157370630145&quot;&gt;contacting the Minister of Railways&lt;/a&gt;, which lead nowhere. I will explain what we did to resolve the issue in depth another time, but if you need help more urgently &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; and I‚Äôll try to help you out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;My top bunk in a 3AC carriage going from Delhi to Agra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trains in India do not have any digital display or voice-over telling you when to get off and you can‚Äôt rely on the schedule as the train will be running late more often than not. Use an app or website like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.railyatri.in/&quot;&gt;RailYatri&lt;/a&gt; which will show you the live running status of your train. You will be completely lost without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pulled in to Agra Cantt railway station about an hour late. As we step off the train onto the platform we hear cries of ‚Äútaxi! taxi!‚Äù directed at us. We learned that in order to get the best deal, you should avoid people like this and instead go out of the station and look for a taxi or tuk tuk by yourself.
It turns out that this station only has one prepaid taxi booth with fixed prices, so it‚Äôs the same price regardless of who you go with. It was expensive, so if you have internet you should use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.olacabs.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ola&lt;/a&gt; for a better deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-around&quot;&gt;Getting around&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only places in Agra you will probably visit are the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort (another UNESCO World Heritage Site). For this the best way to get around is by tuk tuk. You can find them on every corner, now it‚Äôs up to you to negotiate a good deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sightseeing&quot;&gt;Sightseeing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Agra, I‚Äôve mentioned two. The third, Fatehpur Sikri, is located 40 kilometres outside of the city, so we didn‚Äôt make it there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taj-mahal&quot;&gt;Taj Mahal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entry: Rs 1000&lt;/em&gt;. We decided to pry ourselves prematurely from the comfort of our bed at 04:00 to be here for sunrise. We found a tuk tuk pretty easily and arrived at the Taj Mahal entrance at about 05:00 to find a long queue ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nooo!&lt;/em&gt; We thought we were going to miss sunrise. A tour guide hovering near the queue told us that we can skip it if we get a guide. Not wanting to miss what we had gotten up so early for, we didn‚Äôt hesitate in saying yes. We hopped the barrier right in front of the queue as they all watched us, probably thinking &lt;em&gt;cunts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next obstacle: baggage checks. We weren‚Äôt aware of the many &lt;em&gt;Dos&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Donts&lt;/em&gt; for coming here, other than the strict dress code. We each had a book and I had a GoPro selfie stick which security were &lt;em&gt;convinced&lt;/em&gt; was a tripod - two forbidden items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily our guide worked his charm on the guards and we were allowed to bring them in on condition that they stayed in our bags. So yeah, read the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tajmahal.gov.in/do%26nots.html&quot;&gt;list of do‚Äôs and dont‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; provided by the Department of Tourism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We probably would have made it into the palace grounds in time for sunrise, but having a guide was useful because he brought us to the best place to watch the sun rising over the palace. If you want to see it, head towards the mosque situated to the left of the Taj Mahal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OITOh71.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Taj Mahal stands out proudly from the thick morning fog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can probably see from the picture above there is another benefit of coming this early‚Ä¶very few people around! Come at noon and the paths either side of the water will be crowded with tourists, ruining that perfect shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/X9jVq46.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;What a sight: the sun rising from behind the Taj Mahal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We parted ways with our guide after about two hours. If you have the money, hiring a guide is a good idea as you will learn some things you may not have known about this iconic place without some research. Be sure to only hire an approved guide who show their official identity cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GdSiaBE.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Our tour guide knew all the best places to take photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a seat, sat and just watched for a little while. Watched the crowds slowly thicken and the noise level increase, the sun continue to rise high into the sky, and the shifting colours of the Taj Mahal‚Äôs marble surface, influenced by the changing colour of the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vabHNCu.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This photo makes you realise how big the Taj Mahal is&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once outside the palace grounds you will notice something unusual for India (or most places for that matter). It‚Äôs quiet. Polluting vehicles are not allowed within 500 metres of the Taj Mahal, all you will see here are bicycles and electric vehicles. This is a great idea as you really notice the serenity from within the palace grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area outside the palace walls is lined with restaurants and gifts shops, ready to serve the happy tourists enlightened by their visit to the Taj Mahal. Our guide highly recommended a restaurant called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297683-d804436-Reviews-Joney_s_Place-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html?m=19905&quot;&gt;Joney‚Äôs place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked around but couldn‚Äôt find it (and didn‚Äôt have a working SIM card to use Google Maps) so I can‚Äôt attest to it‚Äôs deliciousness, but we did meet someone later in our trip who said he came here twice in the same day it was so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;agra-fort&quot;&gt;Agra Fort&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entry: Rs 550&lt;/em&gt;. Just 2.5 kilometres away, Agra Fort is worth the short journey by tuk tuk. It was the residence of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, before they moved to Delhi because of soaring rent prices and expensive child care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1PjQGFj.jpg&quot; class=&quot;post-image post-image-1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;By 11:00am the entrance to Agra Fort was already bustling with tourists&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the grounds you will find more impressive architecture and well maintained gardens. You might come across two maintenance workers offering you the chance to hold and feed some squirrels. Be aware that they will demand money, but only &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you have fed and held them. I‚Äôm hesitant to call it a scam because most people will cop this before accepting the offer. I am not most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Best friends forever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-on&quot;&gt;Moving on&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that‚Äôs Agra done. Next week I‚Äôll tell you about Udaipur (known as the ‚ÄúWhite City‚Äù) in the state of Rajasthan. This place is really special and so relaxed compared to Delhi and Agra, and was one of our favourite places in all of India.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="india" /><category term="travel" /><category term="backpacking" /><category term="agra" /><category term="tajmahal" /><summary type="html">When people visit Agra - the second stop on India‚Äôs Golden Triangle - they are not coming to see the city that 1.6 million people call home.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000OITOh71.jpg" /></entry></feed>
