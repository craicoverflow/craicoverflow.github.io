      <description>I have been working as a software engineer for just over five years. Every now and then I encounter an idiom during a meeting which I don&amp;rsquo;t understand at all and it is not explained because it is assumed that everyone already understands its meaning. Either everyone else does know what it means or there are a number of people like me, confused but hesitant to ask what it means as it is hard to gauge whether you are the only dumb-dumb who does not know.</description>
