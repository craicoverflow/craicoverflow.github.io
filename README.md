# Personal Website

It has long been a desire of mine to set up a blog to write about the goings on in my life. A combination of some down time while travelling and a want to begin document my travelling experience finally pushed me to do it.

This is the `README` for that blog. If you don't know what that is I have no idea how you ended up here but fair play.
You are probably looking for a link to the site: [endaphelan.me](https://endaphelan.me)

While it might look complete, it is still a work in progress and I will continue to analyse performance analytics, improve and tweak with it.

I built it using Jekyll and it's hosted on GitHub pages, so it is free except for a tiny yearly fee for the domain.

## To do (essentials)

- Set up Jekyll ✔️
- Implement a Jekyll theme ✔️
- Social links ✔️
- Article tagging ✔️
- Links to share articles on social media️ ️️✔️
- Set up a mailing list with Mailchimp ✔️

## Should do (improvements)

- Add text beside article estimating how long an article should take to read on average, like [Medium.com](https://www.medium.com) ✔️
- Host images for articles on Imgur to improve load time ✔️
- Add mailing list sign up form to article (inline) instead of directing users to another page. I imagine it might have a better sign up rate then.
- Create a custom 404 page
- Add Disqus to comments section
