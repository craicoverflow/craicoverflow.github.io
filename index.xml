      <description>The past couple of years have been my busiest ever, both in work and in my personal life. In two years of work I went from a junior to a senior software engineer, and with that came a raft of new responsibilities. In the same two years I had some big life events which required long term planning like which I had never needed before.
I used to cope just fine using my head to keep track of both the short and long term tasks and goals - because there weren&amp;rsquo;t that many happening at the same time.</description>

      <description>I have been working as a software engineer for just over five years. Every now and then I encounter a phrase used to describe something during an engineering discussion, where its meaning is not obvious from the words themselves. These kinds of phrases are known as idioms - expressions that have a non-literal meaning attached to the phrase. &amp;ldquo;Break a leg&amp;rdquo; is a well-known idiom to wish a person good luck.</description>
