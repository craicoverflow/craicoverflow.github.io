If you are considering a visit to India, do it. It's a massive melting pot of different people, cultures, landscapes and food so there is literally plenty of things and places to suit everybody's interests. Yes at times it will challenging, but in the end it will be an extremely rewarding experience in which you will learn so much. We spent one month here and loved *every* second. Read my [other posts]({{site.baseurl}}/tag/india) and see why.

Here's a little montage I put together showing some of the highlights. Enjoy! ðŸ“½
