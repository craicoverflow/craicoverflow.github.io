With a little under a week since the presentation, it's time for another post.

If you weren't at my presentation, here's a [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gPLSOY2X28yUsg8pqX-TisQ-rduSPPEZh6OvId4nLeI/edit?usp=sharing) to the slides.

If you read my previous post, I completely broke my website - no idea what happened. I ended up having to go back to my previous commit, luckily I didn't lose too much work :)

The last few days I began pushing forward with development. I have added a modal dialog for the user to edit and save their personal information (Figure 1 & 2).

My next task is to allow the user to set up a page for their venue or act so that they can then share their events.
