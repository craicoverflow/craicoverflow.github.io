Hampi is a small rural village in the state of Karnataka. Truth be told there's not much happening here, but it's not the village you come for. Things used to be very different in Hampi; this was once a wealthy and thriving city, which became the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 14th century which lasted until 1565 when the empire was defeated and the city destroyed.

Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Hampi is dotted with hundreds of ruined Hindu temples, structures and monuments. It is surrounded by an amazing and unique natural landscape of sandstone boulder hills, covering an area of 26km².

## Getting here

Like everywhere else in this trip, we came here by train. Well, nearly. Hampi itself doesn't have a train station, the nearest being a 30 minute drive away in Hosapete.

Getting here was easy; a short eight hour train ride from Goa (yes eight hours is short in India) had us there by midafternoon and 20 minutes later we were checking into our hotel. The choice of accommodation in Hampi was pretty poor so we decided to base ourselves in Hosapete, which also meant we would be close to the train station for our departure.

We stuck our Hampi visit in between two trips to Goa because getting to Kochi (our next destination) from Hosapete was way too difficult and long. The shortest train journey on this route is almost 26 hours, and that's before you factor in the inevitable delays that would probably drag that up to 29 hours or more. I love trains, but no way am I staying on one for that long.

## Getting around

A lot of Hampi's structures are together in clusters, so for the most part you can easily get around on foot. As Hampi is quite spread out, so are its groups of structures, so you will need another way to cover the longer distances.

It's pretty easy to find a tuk tuk - there are plenty waiting near all of the sights, so we made use of their services once or twice to cover the longer distances. Bicycles are another way to get around and you can rent them in Hampi village, but cycling in that heat would have been a struggle for us.

## Hampi

_Entry: free_. We only had one full day to see Hampi we decided to have an early start to make the most of it. We left our hotel at around 08:30 and immediately spotted a tuk tuk waiting to receive his first customer of the day, and got to Hampi a little after 09:00.

_Joining the morning rush to Hampi_

We didn't want a tour guide shuffling us around to the same few places and missing out on the chance to explore it ourselves, but we also wanted to know what it is we are looking at and how to find our way around.

We found a small Hampi guidebook book for sale in our hotel and bought it for around Rs. 150 (less than €2). This really came in handy as we could just pop it open at any time and read about everything on the spot. This let us to go at our own pace and for a fraction of the price of a tour guide.

It's totally free to get in to Hampi and to see most of the ruins. However, if you want to see some of the main monuments and temples there is a fee of Rs. 500 for foreigners. Virupaksha Temple costs an additional Rs. 2 to go inside but we didn't even bother as someone told us that it's nothing special.

### Matanga Hill

If you ever decide to come here you should definitely climb Matanga Hill. It is the highest point in all of Hampi and so you truly get a unique viewpoint of the ancient city, and on a clear day you will be able to see for miles around. It's not very difficult to climb, but the heat and humidity of the day poses the greatest challenge to you making it to the top.

_Beginning the ascent of Matanga Hill_

That's one reason it is probably better to go for sunrise or sunset, the other being the amazing views at these times. We started the ascent at around 11:00, just as the temperature was moving from hot (32°C) to _very hot_ (34°C).

The views from the top of this boulder hill were simply amazing. In the distance we could see the massive Virupaksha Temple, which was made to look so small and insignificant from up here. Maybe it was because of the time of day but there was nobody here except Gareth, Sarah and I! No waiting for a gap between people to get a nice view and nobody getting in the way of our photos!

## Moving on

Once again, we felt that we didn't give ourselves enough time here. We could easily have spent another full day or more wandering around Hampi and getting off the beaten track. Nonetheless, what an amazing place. I definitely want to return here some day and spend a couple of days exploring it, taking my time and soaking it all in.

Back to Goa after this, but I've <a href="/travel/india/a-month-in-india-goa">already talked about that</a>. So next we will be going to our final state in India: Kerala. There's lots to see in Kerala but we decided to slow it down and limit our last seven days in India to two places - Kochi and then Kovalam, where disaster struck...
