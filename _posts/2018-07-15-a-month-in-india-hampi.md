I was really looking forward to visiting Hampi, probably more so than any other place in India. I read about it briefly when we were planning our trip and instantly wanted to go there, even if it was a little bit out of the way. I made a decision to minimise visual research (videos, photos) to retain that element of surprise when we got there.

We only had one full day to visit so we decided to make an early start to make the most of it. We left our hotel at around 08:30 and arrived to Hampi a little bit after 09:00. I should probably give a brief synopys of Hampi first to give you some context.

This magnificent UNESCO World Heritage Site is dotted with the ruins of over 500 Hindu temples and structures and surrounded by a unique natural landscape of sandstone boulder hills, stretching over an area of 26kmÂ².

We didn't want to get a tour guide as this is pretty restrictive and ties your day down to a semi-fixed schedule. We also wanted to know what the hell we were looking at and what its significance is/was. So what's the solution?
