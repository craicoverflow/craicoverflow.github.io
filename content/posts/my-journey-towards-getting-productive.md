Up until relatively recently in my life I had been getting by with using my head as my primary store of all the long and short-term tasks I needed to do - both in work and outside of it.
After a certain threshold this primitive method began to struggle as the number of things I needed to do in a pretty short period. My system lagged behind and I struggled to keep track and complete everything that I needed to do.
I reached a conclusion that my head-based organisational system was no longer fit for purpose and I needed to do something about it.

And so I began a journey towards getting more organised and setting up workflows which would enable me to become more productive. I tried out several methods and tools - some worked and many others did not. This is not a definitive list of what will work and what won't work, rather it is a reflection on what techniques I have started to employ to keep organized, focused and productive.

## Fully utilizing my calendar

It used to be a very rare occurence when I needed to put something into my calendar. This suited me fine at the time - I didn't really *need* to use it as I did not have that many that many appointments or dates to save so my head was sufficiently capable of remembering.
I did heavily use my calendar in work however as working in a remote distributed team heavily depends on it to operate smoothly.

As the need increased I began to use Google Calendar more and more. I shared it with my partner and vice-versa so we both have good visibility when needing to schedule appointments on behalf of both of us. I also shared my personal calendar with my work calendar to give myself a single view of my full schedule.

## Inbox Zero

I've been a GMail user since it was still invite-only in 2006. In all that time once I had finished processing an email received to my inbox sent I did not do anything with it. I just left it in my inbox, unread and cluttering my screen even though I had no plans to ever interact with it again. It would eventually go away, pushed down the screen by a number of other emails I will never read again.

If I was not ready to process an email I opened I did one of two things: snooze it **or** mark it as unread. I see now that these are both very archaic ways of handling things.
By snoozing it I was simply kicking the can down the road a little bit, to be reminded on some atribrary date which often has no relationship to when I need to action it.
By marking it as unread I was ensuring I would forget about the email as it gets pushed in with the thousands of other uncategorised emails still sitting in my inbox.

I now follow an "Inbox Zero" approach to email management where I archive or delete emails I have finished with and use a label and filter-based workflow to categorise those emails that I need to do something with.

## Getting Things Done

My biggest productivity struggle was that I did not have a coordinated system in place to capture and subsequently manage all of my tasks and projects. I tried a number of ways to capture tasks - from simple pen and paper to digital tools. These failed to be effective for so many reasons and I usually ended up falling back to using my head to do the work.

I decided to give the [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/) methodology after seeing it recommended on Twitter.
At a high level it involves five simple steps to organization: _Capture, Clarify, Organize, Review,_ and _Engage_.

The book was easy to read and was extremely helpful. The great thing about it was I was able to slowly integrate the GTD methods into my life as I progressed through it - there was no need to reach the end before fully understanding it.

## The Pomodoro Technique

[The Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) is something that I sometimes use, and even then I am not strict about it.
It is a very simple technique - set a 25 minute timer and focus on a single task, then take a five minute break. You are also supposed to block out other distractions but this is a little bit harder to do for me as our work instant messaging application frequently calls out for a response on a discussion where my input is necessary to allow the discussion to continue.
I also only call upon this technique when I need it as some days my work could be a little less defined or is broken up by meetings so it would make no sense to try to fit it in.
The main reason I use this technique when I do is to remind myself to take regular breaks. On days where I have not been using it I can find myself losing track of time while stuck on a task and going for far too long without getting up for a walk or stretch.

## Todoist

[Todoist](https://todoist.com/) is a feature-rich task management application that I have tried to use many times over the years but failed, simply because I did not have an organization system in place and the extent of how it could be useful was lost on me. I once again tried it out when I began to use GTD and thanks to its flexibility I was able to shape it to match the exact workflow that I was trying to create. It also has dozens of free integrations available such as Google Calendar two-way synchronization. I can safely say if I tried to use pen and paper or Google Tasks with the GTD methodology I would have failed to keep it up. There are probably other tools which work similarly to Todoist but this is the one for me.

## Closing distractions

How often do you check your emails? Maybe you get a pop-up whenever one comes in? Or if you're like me your eyes frequently shoot up to the pinned email tab to see if it has changed from **Inbox** to **Inbox (1)**. I cannot leave something unread when I know it's there, so I will rip myself away from what I am doing and read the email. 90% of the time it's not something I need to action immediately, if at all yet I've still interrrupted myself to go and read it and must refocus myself on what I was doing before..something which takes some time.
So what's the solution? Recently I have started to close my email tab and check it at fixed times throughout the day. I get notified by my calendar so I know it's time to check, otherwise they are out of sight and out of mind.

Instant messaging services like Slack, Microsoft Teams are used heavily by most companies these days. They have a benefit of being able to engage in a quicker and less formal conversation than you get with email. You are always just a quick message away from someone who needs you and that can be fantastic tool for collaboration in a distributed team. What is a positive however can also be viewed as a negative and the problem is that you are always just a message away from someone. It can be very, very hard to remain focused on something when your messaging app frequently notifies you both visually and audibly that you have a message.
I used to leave my messaging app always open, sometimes even dedicating my secondary monitor to it so that I would be highly available. These days, I close my chat application when the thing that I am doing requires my focus (like this blog post) and I have it open in between focus windows.

## Conclusion

In school you learn the fundamentals of a broad spectrum of subjects that help prepare you for the next stage, be that higher education or work. In college you learn the fundamentals of your chosen discipline, along with some extras which are useful to land the job you want like interview preparation and how to build a CV. From then on the things you learn about are more or less on yourself, sometimes you might have support from your employer to enrol in a course or training (I have been lucky to have excellent support in this regard).

Productivity and self-organization is not something we are all taught automatically as a life skill but I can imagine if I knew what I know today that staying on top of the mountain of work that I had in college would have been a lot easier.
It is probably because it is not such a straightforward thing to teach; different systems work well for different people and teaching one way could be counter-productive.

This has been my productivity journey so far, and I am in no doubt that it's not yet close to the finish line. The key is to continuosly reflect on what works and what doesn't work. I will continue to refine my system to make it better, and I won't be afraid to stop using something if I find an alternative that works better for me.
