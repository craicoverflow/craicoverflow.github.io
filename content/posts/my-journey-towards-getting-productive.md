Up until relatively recently in my life I had been getting by with using my head as my primary store of all the long and short-term tasks I needed to do - both in work and personal environments.
This worked for me...up to a point. The number of responsibilites I increased in a fairly short period of time and my system lagged behind - I struggled to track everything I needed to do. I also had a number of goals I wanted to achieve outside of work which also complicated matters.
My head-based organisation system was no longer fit for purpose and I began struggling to keep track of all the things that I needed to do.

So I began a journey towards getting organised and more productive. I tried out several methods - some that worked and others that didn't.

## The things that worked for me

### Fully utilizing my calendar

I used to rarely use a calendar for tracking key dates and appointments. I didn't always require it as I did not have many important dates to track too far into the future and I was able to store them in my head. I did heavily use my calendar in work however as working in a remote distributed team heavily depends on it to operate smoothly.

I began to use Google Calendar for my main appointments, shared it with my partner and vice-versa to have good visibility when needing to schedule appointments on behalf of both of us. I also shared my calendar to my work calendar to give myself a single view of my schedule.

### Inbox Zero

For my entire life once I had finished processing an email sent to me I did not do anything with it. I just left it in my inbox, unread and cluttering my screen even though I had no plans to ever interact with it again.
If I was not ready to process an email I opened I did one of two things: snooze it **or** mark it as unread. These are both very archaic ways of handling things. By snoozing it I was simply kicking the can down the road a little bit. By marking it as unread I was ensuring I would not lose the email as it gets pushed in with the thousands of other uncategorised emails still sitting in my inbox.

I now follow an "Inbox Zero" approach to email management where I archive or delete emails I have finished with and use a label and filter-based workflow to categorise those emails that I need to do something with.

### Getting Things Done

My biggest productivity struggle was that I did not have a coordinated system in place to capture and subsequently manage all of my tasks and projects. I tried a number of ways to capture tasks - from simple pen and paper to digital tools. These failed to be effective for so many reasons and I usually ended up falling back to using my head to do the work.

I decided to give the [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/) methodology after seeing it recommended on Twitter.
At a high level it involves five simple steps to organization: _Capture, Clarify, Organize, Review,_ and _Engage_.

The book was easy to read and was extremely helpful. The great thing about it was I was able to slowly integrate the GTD methods into my life as I progressed through it - there was no need to reach the end before fully understanding it.

### The Pomodoro Technique

[The Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) is something that I sometimes use, and even then I am not strict about it.
It is a very simple technique - set a 25 minute timer and focus on a single task, then take a five minute break. You are also supposed to block out other distractions but this is a little bit harder to do for me as our work instant messaging application frequently calls out for a response on a discussion where my input is necessary to allow the discussion to continue.
I also only call upon this technique when I need it as some days my work could be a little less defined or is broken up by meetings so it would make no sense to try to fit it in.
The main reason I use this technique when I do is to remind myself to take regular breaks. On days where I have not been using it I can find myself losing track of time while stuck on a task and going for far too long without getting up for a walk or stretch.

### Todoist

[Todoist](https://todoist.com/) is a feature-rich task management application that I have tried to use many times over the years but failed, simply because I did not have an organization system in place and the extent of how it could be useful was lost on me. I once again tried it out when I began to use GTD and thanks to its flexibility I was able to shape it to match the exact workflow that I was trying to create. It also has dozens of free integrations available such as Google Calendar two-way synchronization. I can safely say if I tried to use pen and paper or Google Tasks with the GTD methodology I would have failed to keep it up. There are probably other tools which work similarly to Todoist but this is the one for me.

## Conclusion

In school you learn the fundamentals of a broad spectrum of subjects that help prepare you for the next stage, be that higher education or work. In college you learn the fundamentals of your chosen discipline, along with some extras which are useful to land the job you want like interview preparation and how to build a CV. From then on the things you learn about are more or less on yourself, sometimes you might have support from your employer to enrol in a course or training (I have been lucky to have excellent support in this regard).

Productivity and self-organization is not something we are all taught automatically as a life skill but I can imagine if I knew what I know today that staying on top of the mountain of work that I had in college would have been a lot easier.
It is probably because it is not such a straightforward thing to teach; different systems work well for different people and teaching one way could be counter-productive.

This has been my productivity journey so far, and I am in no doubt that it's not yet close to the finish line. The key is to continuosly reflect on what works and what doesn't work. I will continue to refine my system to make it better, and I won't be afraid to stop using something if I find an alternative that works better for me.
