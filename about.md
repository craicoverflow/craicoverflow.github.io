Born in England in 1993 to Irish parents, I moved to county [Sligo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sligo) 18 months later, where I lived right up until I was [22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgFeZr5ptV8). I am currently in Cambodia on a backpacking trip around South Asia with my girlfriend with no idea when we will be home üòÅ, I will probably post here occasionally about this and that.<br/>My interests change regularly, but my favourite things in the world right now are music, travelling and programming. 

17 is quite a young age to decide what career path you're going to take, but that's the way it is. I hadn't a clue what I wanted to do, so I chose software development. It wasn't a totally random choice as I always had an interest in computers, but it was still a step into the unknown. We had a computers class once a week in school, but it didn't have a purpose; the only thing we did was play games online or do homework for our other classes.

I am so happy with the path that I chose - I love programming and everything that goes with it (even the meetings). In my spare time you might find me learning a new language or reading about yet another JavaScript framework I apparently need!
