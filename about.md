Born in England in October 1993 to Irish parents, I moved to county [Sligo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sligo) 18 months later, where I lived right up until I was 22. I am currently in Cambodia on a backpacking trip around South Asia with my girlfriend with no idea when we will be home üòÅ, I will probably post here occasionally about this and that.<br/>My interests change regularly, but my favourite things in the world right now are music, travelling and programming. 

17 is quite a young age to decide what career path you're going to take, but that's the way it is. I hadn't a clue what I wanted to do, so I chose software development. It wasn't a totally random choice as I always had an interest in computers, but it was still a step into the unknown. We had a computers class once a week in school, but it didn't have a purpose; the only thing we did was play games online or do homework for our other classes.

Looking back I am so happy with the path that I chose - I love programming and everything that goes with it (even the meetings). In my spare time you might find me learning a new language or reading about yet another JavaScript framework that I apparently need!

## Experience

I have 2 years' experience as a professional software engineer, working mostly with JavaScript, PHP or C# complimented with a number of other technologies.

In my most recent job at [Qpercom](https://www.qpercom.com) I was employed as a full stack software engineer. My main role was to develop a web application built using AngularJS, Slim Framework (PHP) and MySQL, but I also worked on a number of side projects that included moving some of our applications to Docker, upgrading the main website's UI and implementing a code-review process with the help of Gerrit.<br/>

Before Qpercom I did a five month paid internship in Vulcan Solutions (now [Codec-dss](http://www.codec.ie)). I joined an agile team of four experienced engineers where I helped to develop Microsoft Dynamics CRM solutions and ASP.NET web applications.

## Education

I studied Computing in Software Development for four years at [IT Sligo](https://www.itsligo.ie/). For the first three years the focus was on object-oriented programming, primarily on the .NET platform with C#. In third year there was a group project and a three-month industry work placement.

The fourth year was optional - we learned ‚Äãadvanced software development concepts and techniques, including artificial intelligence, advanced .NET programming, mobile development and human computer interaction.<br/>

I graduated from IT Sligo in 2016, receiving an award for finishing with the highest GPA in my class.
